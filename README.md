# WOWS_PuertoRicoCalculator

This program can calculate your time for completing the mission in World of Warships. 
The program is written generic so you can easily change the target value for other upcoming events in the future. 

## Features:

 - Add already saved points ("Aktueller Punktestand")
 - Add your current rate of points per minute (PPM)
 - Set the target points ("Gesamtpunktzahl") 
 - Calculate the time you will need (if it's red you will run out of time)
 - The program will give you a minimum value of points per minute, depending on your current progress that is needed to complete the task in time
